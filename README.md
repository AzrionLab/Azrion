## 🧠 AI Functionality

Azrion’s intelligence core is powered by five interconnected AI modules. Each function operates in real-time, processing live blockchain data to detect volatility, manipulation, and hidden risk patterns. Together, they form the reactive and predictive backbone of the system.

### 1. 🧿 CorePulse — Transaction Risk Analyzer

```python
def core_pulse(current_price, previous_price, token_volume, market_liquidity):
    deviation_factor = abs(current_price - previous_price) / previous_price
    liquidity_impact = token_volume / market_liquidity
    risk_score = deviation_factor * liquidity_impact

    if risk_score > 0.75:
        return "Alert: High Transaction Risk Detected"
    else:
        return "Transaction Risk Low"
```
#### AI Role:
Acts as Azrion’s threat sensor. It analyzes sudden price movements in relation to liquidity conditions. Volatile behavior in shallow pools is ranked as high risk. CorePulse continuously updates its "abnormality" thresholds using live blockchain feedback.

### 2. 💧 LiquidGuard — Asset Liquidity Monitor

```python
def liquid_guard(token_volume, market_liquidity, threshold=0.25):
    liquidity_ratio = token_volume / market_liquidity
    return "Alert: Low Liquidity Detected" if liquidity_ratio < threshold else "Asset Liquidity Normal"
```
#### AI Role:
Monitors exit risk by tracking how thin a token’s liquidity becomes. It learns from token-specific volume behavior and flags assets with high slippage or manipulation potential.

### 3. 🧠 QuantumRisk — Predictive Risk Forecasting

```js
function quantumRisk(assetData) {
  const volatilityRisk = assetData.priceFluctuation / assetData.marketLiquidity;
  const riskFactor = volatilityRisk * assetData.marketVolume;

  if (riskFactor > 1) {
    return 'Alert: High Risk Predicted';
  } else {
    return 'Risk Level Low';
  }
}
```
#### AI Role:
Forecasts upcoming threats by analyzing market volume in unstable liquidity environments. It learns from past alert outcomes and adapts risk modeling accordingly.

### 4. 🕒 ChronoShift — Time Deviation Detector

```python
import time

def chrono_shift(transaction_timestamp, time_threshold=5000):
    time_deviation = abs(transaction_timestamp - int(time.time() * 1000))
    return "Alert: Time Deviation Detected" if time_deviation > time_threshold else "Transaction Synchronized"
```
#### AI Role:
Tracks the timing of blockchain events to spot delays, spoofed syncs, or bot-driven latency exploits. Thresholds auto-adjust per chain and behavior trend.

### 5. ⚖️ RiskSync — Multi-Layer Risk Calculator

```js
function riskSync(transactionData) {
  const priceImpact = (transactionData.currentPrice - transactionData.previousPrice) / transactionData.previousPrice;
  const marketDepth = transactionData.volume / transactionData.marketLiquidity;

  const totalRisk = priceImpact * marketDepth;

  if (totalRisk > 0.6) {
    return 'Alert: High-Risk Transaction Detected';
  } else {
    return 'Transaction Safe';
  }
}
```
#### AI Role:
Combines liquidity depth and price movement to calculate a transaction’s systemic impact. Captures hidden whale moves and coordinated bot activity.

### 🧬 System Architecture Highlights
- 🔁 Real-Time Inputs: Functions process blockchain data non-stop — including trades, LP flows, and wallet behavior.
- 📈 Feedback Loop Learning: Alert outcomes are scored (e.g., token dumped after alert), improving future predictions.
- 🧩 Cross-Module Enrichment: Outputs are fused into advanced systems like TrendGuard, FutureScope, and Flashloan Radar.
- 📊 Dynamic Thresholding: Azrion adapts to market phase — risk sensitivity changes based on live token behavior.

#### These AI modules aren’t just reactive. They evolve. Azrion doesn’t just detect patterns — it learns to anticipate them.
